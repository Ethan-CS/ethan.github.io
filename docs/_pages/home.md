## Welcome to my page

I'm Ethan, and this site is where I post about my research as a PhD student. You will find some information about me, what I'm getting up to, the types of things I'm happy to collaborate on and also some little bits of interesting material! I hope this is an interesting introduction, but please feel free to get in contact if you would like to chat about collaboration, life as a PhD student and so on.


### A note on the use of markdown

This site, hosted on GitHub, is written using the Jekyll theme Minimalist using Markdown and is therefore relatively lighteweight. This is intentional: I don't want this to be a difficult or slow webpage to load, as some visitors may have low internet access and I don't wish to exclude anyone who'd like to learn more about what I'm up to.
