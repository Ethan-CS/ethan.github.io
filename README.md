# ethan.github.io

Welcome! This is the repo that builds my [webpage](https://ethan.github.io/). To create this repo, I forked the repo [mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) so that my page uses the minimal-mistakes theme it creates. Of course, I've done a lot of adapting to make the site my own but I'm hugely grateful to the creators and contributors over there for making an amazing and highly customisable (even for non-web developers like me) theme for GitHub pages.
