## Welcome to my page


I'm Ethan, and this site is where I post about my research as a PhD student. You will find some information about me, what I'm getting up to, the types of things I'm happy to collaborate on and also some little bits of interesting material! I hope this is an interesting introduction, but please feel free to get in contact if you would like to chat about collaboration, life as a PhD student and so on.


Above, you can find links to the pages on this site. You can read about me and who I am in [About me](/about-me/), see what my research concerns in [Research](/research/) and see my qualifications and experience in [CV](/cv/). I also put any interesting tidbits of information that don't fit into these sections in either [General Information](/general-information/) or [Useful Links](/useful-links/). In the latter, you can find links to my research and staff pages at the University of Glasgow, where I'm studying for my PhD.


I'm sure it won't go unnoticed that this is a fairly simple page, as they go nowadays; this is done with intent. Many students I work with in the modules that I help teach at the University are in areas where internet connectivity is not fast generally, others have daily or monthly limits on data usage, and I would not like to restrict anyone subject to those constraints from viewing my page. I'm glad enough if anyone reads it, so I wish to make it as accessible as possible!


Feel free to contact me through any of the links to the left side of this site; email is the fastes way to reach me, but choose whichever method you prefer to get in touch. In any case, check back anytime as I try and keep this site updated as best I can. Thanks for visiting!
