Hello! My name's Ethan and I'm a PhD student at the University of Glasgow. I officially started my PhD on 1 October 2020, with the official title:

> Game-theoretic and probabilistic methods applied
> to spatial network models of contagion.

What this means in practice is that I study games played on "graphs" (also called networks) and how, by introducing some grey areas using probabilities and such like, I can play these games as models for the spread of diseases (or fires in forests, memes on social networks - the applications are very broad). Most of the work done in this area so far assumes lots of simplifying measures, such as 'regular graphs' which translate to a network of individuals being a well-mixed population where everyone has the same number of contacts. We know this isn't very true to the reality of the situation, so using probabilistic methods we can introduce some more useful random distributions, where some people know loads of other people and other people come into contact with very few people regularly. Further, we can make the contagion (be it a disease, meme or such like) transmit with a given probability, thereby providing the model with a more interesting spreading pattern than is usually assumed in the literature, which can make our strategy for defence against the contagion far more interesting and useful. Game theory comes into this in a special way when we not only think of ourselves as defending against this contagion, but think of the contagion as another player; perhaps we want to know what the contagion's best strategy is, if it were a virus with genes edited so that it gives any host it infects resistance to a particular disease, for instance. Of course, this context comes with all sorts of ethical considerations that are far from trivial, and this is something I'm also very interested in exploring in my work.


In my spare time, I'm a keen artist (though my keenness doesn't make up for my amateurism) and musician. I play the viola, and have done so in several orchestras because everyone always needs a viola player, and when I was around 14 I taught myself to play the piano, which in turn led to me teaching myself to play the organ. This latter instrument is the one I'm usually playing at the moment; organists are in constant demand for "hatches, matches and dispatches" as a colleague once told me. Outside of these contexts, I am a Lanfine organ student to the University of Glasgow, meaning I get to play for many wonderful celebrations of academic achievements as well as very old traditions and ceremonies still held by the University. The best part is I can go and practice on the chapel organ, on the main campus of the University, whenever I please - so long as I don't get carried away and disturb the teaching that goes on near the chapel! I enjoy all things analogue: whether it's building a bottle rack from scratch or repairing used furniture, wood-working is another way to go from using only my brain all day to involving my hands in a construction process. I've also gone a little more intricate, in electrical engineering. I'm now never far from a soldering iron; I don't know any electrical appliance (besides computers) that hasn't at least been opened up at this point!
