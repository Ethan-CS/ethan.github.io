# My Publications


While I haven't had anything published so far (give me time, I'm only in my first year of my PhD!) below are some papers and literature reviews I've written that may prove useful or indeed interesting to someone, somewhere under perhaps a strange set of circumstances...


Feel free to get in touch with me to discuss any of these pieces of research!



* My degree project (like a dissertation), submitted in 2020 in partial fulfilment for my BSc in Mathematics and Philosophy: [Mathematics of the Pipe Organ](https://ethankelly.github.io/assets/MathematicsOfThePipeOrgan.pdf)
