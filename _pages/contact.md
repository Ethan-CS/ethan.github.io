# My Contact Details

You can see a very brief overview of my contact details in my "Author Profile," which may be either at the top or the left of this text (and on most of the pages on this site). This page gives a little more detail about getting in touch! I'm always happy to chat, whether you're another researcher considering a collaboration, you need me to look at some differential equations (preferred option) or you want to ask how I finally managed to learn Handel's _The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba_ on the organ! (Spoilers: I make up the left hand and pedal accompaniment...).


## Email

You can reach me at either of my University of Glasgow email addresses:
* [e.kelly.1@research.gla.ac.uk](mailto:e.kelly.1@research.gla.ac.uk) (research student account, preferred)
* [Ethan.Kelly@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:Ethan.Kelly@glasgow.ac.uk) (staff account)

## Office

Pandemic notwithstanding, I'm generally here:

_Room 502, 
Sir Alwyn Williams Building, 
School of Computing Science, 
University of Glasgow, 
Glasgow, 
G12 8RZ_


## Internal methods

If you're at the University of Glasgow, either studying or employed, you should be able to reach me on Microsoft Teams (look me up by name or by email) which normally gets a fast response. You could also potentially reach me via Zoom (again, look up by name or email).



## Social media

While I don't currently have any publicly accessible social media, this section is here in part to remind me to set them up! This will be the first place I put any relevant accounts if I ever get round to it.
