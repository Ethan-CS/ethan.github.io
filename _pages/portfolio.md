This is a hub for the writing I've done to try and engage readers with what I'm doing in my research, hopefully no matter how technical their background is in this area of computing. This collection is ongoing, so expect this page to change frequently (and sometimes have nothing at all if I'm overhauling structure or such like). I want to constantly improve these posts so that they are engaging, understandable and informative. Scientific engagement is incredibly important to me, and I wouldn't be honouring my commitment to accessibility of academic research if I wasn't representing my research in this way.
